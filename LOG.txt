LOG OF CHANGES AND UPDATES

Apr. 29, 2021: Corrected error in "sparce" eigenvector
               diagonalization method in SuperQuantModel

Apr. 29, 2021: Added a template "Template_for_Circuit_Calculator_scipy.py"
               similar to "Template_for_Circuit_Calculator.py".
               However, the new template uses diagonalization method from
               scipy.sparse library which allows to calculate only a set 
               number of lowest eigenstates.
               The older template "Template_for_Circuit_Calculator.py"
               uses the diagonalization method from the numpy library
               which calculates all the eigenvalues, but slower.
